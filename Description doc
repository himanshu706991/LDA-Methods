To create a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the "operational_risk_dataset.csv" file, I'll walk you through a detailed step-by-step EDA process and outline user stories leading up to the calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) using the Log-Normal and Poisson methods. Finally, I'll format this into a Word document for easy reference.

Here's an overview of the EDA process and the user stories we'll cover:

EDA Process and User Stories Outline
1. Data Loading and Overview
Objective: Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Steps:
Load the data into a DataFrame.
Check for data types, null values, and overall structure.
User Story:
As a data analyst, I need to load and verify the structure of the dataset to ensure all columns are correctly typed and that there are no immediate data quality issues.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Objective: Clean the data to prepare it for analysis.
Steps:
Handle missing values, if any, by either filling or dropping them based on relevance.
Standardize date formats and extract useful components like year, month, and day.
Convert columns with symbols or non-standard characters for ease of processing.
User Story:
As a data analyst, I need to clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency, standardize formats, and remove or impute any missing values for reliable analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Gain insights into each feature through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Steps:
Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, std deviation) for Net Loss Amount.
Visualize distributions of key columns: Net Loss Amount, Event Type, and Business Line.
Check for correlations among features (if applicable).
Identify potential outliers in Net Loss Amount.
User Story:
As a data analyst, I want to understand the distribution and basic statistics of the dataset to identify any unusual patterns, high-risk event types, or business lines with frequent operational risks.
4. Outlier Detection and Handling
Objective: Identify and handle outliers in Net Loss Amount to ensure analysis accuracy.
Steps:
Use a threshold (e.g., ±3 standard deviations) to detect outliers.
Cap or remove extreme values in Net Loss Amount to reduce the impact of outliers on statistical analysis.

As a data analyst, I want to create meaningful features that will allow for more specific insights into operational risks by year, business line, and event type.
6. Event Frequency and Severity Analysis Using LDA
Objective: Model the frequency and severity of events using Loss Distribution Approach (LDA).

Use Log-Normal distribution for severity modeling (Net Loss Amount).
Calculate the 99% Value-at-Risk (VaR) for each business line and event type.
User Story:
As a data scientist, I need to model the frequency and severity of events to estimate Value-at-Risk (VaR) at a 99% confidence level, ensuring that the bank’s risk exposure is adequately assessed.
7. Calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR)
Objective: Estimate the potential high-loss threshold for each business line and event type.
Steps:
Calculate VaR using the mean and standard deviation of Net Loss Amount and a 99% confidence level.
User Story:
As a risk manager, I need to know the 99% VaR for each event type and business line to ensure that the bank holds sufficient capital to cover potential operational risks.
Detailed EDA Code and Analysis Steps
For each step listed above, I’ll write detailed code and explanations, and provide visualizations where applicable. Here’s a sample of how the calculations will be presented in the Word document.

Sample Code Snippet for Calculating Value-at-Risk
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm, lognorm

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("operational_risk_dataset.csv")

# Extract Year from Date for year-wise analysis
df['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']).dt.year

# Group by Year, Business Line, and Event Type for VaR calculation
def calculate_var(group):
    # Frequency using Poisson
    event_count = group.shape[0]
    
    # Severity using Log-Normal distribution
    mean_log = np.log(group['Net Loss Amount'][group['Net Loss Amount'] > 0]).mean()
    std_log = np.log(group['Net Loss Amount'][group['Net Loss Amount'] > 0]).std()
    
    # Calculate 99% VaR
    VaR_severity = lognorm.ppf(0.99, s=std_log, scale=np.exp(mean_log))
    
    return pd.Series({
        "Event Count": event_count,
        "99% VaR Severity": VaR_severity
    })

results = df.groupby(["Year", "Business Line", "Event Type"]).apply(calculate_var).reset_index()

# Save results to CSV
results.to_csv("detailed_eda_operational_risk.csv", index=False)

Event Type Distribution: Bar plot of event types and their frequency.
Net Loss Amount Distribution: Histogram with the normal curve overlay.
Outliers in Net Loss Amount: Boxplot to identify outliers.
Year-wise Analysis: Line chart showing total losses over years.

why using log normal on net loss
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The Log-Normal distribution is commonly used for modeling the severity of financial losses, including operational risks like Net Loss Amount in a dataset, for several reasons:

1. Skewed and Heavy-Tailed Nature of Financial Losses
Operational losses, especially those related to events like fraud or system failures, are typically right-skewed. Most losses are small, but there are occasional large losses, leading to a distribution with a long right tail.
The Log-Normal distribution is ideal for modeling such skewed data because it allows for a few very large values without affecting the distribution’s fit for smaller, more common values.
2. Positive Values Only
The Log-Normal distribution is only defined for positive values, which is well-suited for Net Loss Amount, as financial losses cannot be negative (in the context of their absolute size).
Since taking the logarithm of values requires positive numbers, applying the Log-Normal distribution assumes that the data is positive, which aligns with most financial loss data.
3. Capturing Multiplicative Effects
Operational losses often arise from compounding factors (e.g., a system outage affecting multiple departments), making the overall loss a result of multiplicative rather than additive effects.
The Log-Normal distribution naturally models this, as it assumes that the logarithm of the variable (e.g., loss severity) is normally distributed. This property helps capture the compounding nature of operational risks effectively.
4. Practical and Empirical Support
Empirically, the Log-Normal distribution has been shown to fit well for a wide range of financial and operational loss data across industries.
Many risk management frameworks, including those used in banking and insurance, recommend the Log-Normal distribution for operational risk severity modeling due to its flexibility and accurate fit for extreme values.
Example Calculation of Log-Normal Parameters
To model Net Loss Amount with a Log-Normal distribution:

Log-transform the data to make it closer to a normal distribution.
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed values.
Use these values to model severity and calculate metrics like Value-at-Risk (VaR).
Why Not Use a Normal Distribution?
The Normal distribution is symmetric and would not adequately capture the right-skewed, heavy-tailed nature of Net Loss Amount. Using a Normal distribution could lead to an underestimation of extreme values, which are critical in risk management for calculating sufficient capital reserves.

Summary
The Log-Normal distribution is preferred for Net Loss Amount in operational risk because it:

Models the skewed, heavy-tailed nature of loss data.
Ensures all values are positive.
Accounts for multiplicative effects often seen in operational risk.
This makes it well-suited for calculating metrics like Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess the potential impact of extreme losses. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
