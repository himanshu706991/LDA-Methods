  This code snippet loads a dataset and identifies and handles outliers in the Net Loss Amount column by using the mean and standard deviation. It caps outliers that fall beyond three standard deviations from the mean, bringing them within a defined threshold. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Code Explanation
1. Import Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy provides support for numerical operations, such as handling arrays and defining conditions.
2. Load the Dataset
python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv("operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv")
This line loads data from the CSV file operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv into a DataFrame called df.
3. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation
python
Copy code
mean_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].mean()
std_dev_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].std()
mean_loss: The average of the Net Loss Amount values.
std_dev_loss: The standard deviation of Net Loss Amount, which measures the spread of values around the mean. It helps quantify the typical distance of values from the average.
4. Define Outlier Thresholds
python
Copy code
outlier_threshold_high = mean_loss + 3 * std_dev_loss
outlier_threshold_low = mean_loss - 3 * std_dev_loss
These thresholds identify the range beyond which values are considered outliers:
High threshold: Values more than three standard deviations above the mean.
Low threshold: Values more than three standard deviations below the mean.
The choice of "3 standard deviations" is based on the empirical rule (or 68-95-99.7 rule), which states that about 99.7% of data in a normal distribution falls within three standard deviations of the mean.
5. Cap the Outliers
python
Copy code
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] > outlier_threshold_high, outlier_threshold_high, df["Net Loss Amount"])
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] < outlier_threshold_low, outlier_threshold_low, df["Net Loss Amount"])
Here, the code modifies the Net Loss Amount values that exceed the thresholds:
Values above the outlier_threshold_high are capped (set) to outlier_threshold_high.
Values below the outlier_threshold_low are capped to outlier_threshold_low.
Using np.where, this process ensures that extreme values do not skew analyses and that outliers remain within a more reasonable range.
6. Display Results
python
Copy code
print(df.head())
print(f"\nHigh Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_high:,.2f}")
print(f"Low Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_low:,.2f}")
The first few rows of the capped DataFrame are printed using df.head().
The thresholds for high and low outliers are displayed, showing the calculated values formatted as currency.
Summary of Purpose
Capping outliers by setting a maximum and minimum range helps make the data more robust for analysis, ensuring that extremely high or low values do not overly influence calculations such as averages or variances. This approach can provide a more stable basis for data-driven decisions and helps maintain data quality in operational risk analysis.

Here’s a documentation template for the code that detects and caps outliers in the Net Loss Amount column. This can be used for sharing with team members or as part of project documentation.

Documentation: Outlier Detection and Capping for Net Loss Amount
Overview
This document provides an explanation of the code that identifies and caps outliers in the Net Loss Amount column of the dataset operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv. Outlier capping is achieved using a threshold based on the mean and standard deviation of the data. This approach helps mitigate the effect of extreme values on statistical analyses.

Requirements
Python Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and loading CSV files.
numpy: For handling numeric data and implementing conditional logic.
Install these libraries if they are not already installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Code Walkthrough
1. Import Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
This section imports the required libraries:

pandas: Used for data manipulation.
numpy: Used for numerical operations, such as defining conditional statements to cap outliers.
2. Load the Dataset
python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv("operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv")
This line loads the dataset operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv into a pandas DataFrame called df. The dataset should contain a column named Net Loss Amount for the code to work as intended.

3. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of Net Loss Amount
python
Copy code
mean_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].mean()
std_dev_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].std()
This step calculates the mean and standard deviation of the Net Loss Amount column:

mean_loss: Represents the average loss amount.
std_dev_loss: Measures the dispersion or spread of Net Loss Amount values around the mean.
4. Define Outlier Thresholds
python
Copy code
outlier_threshold_high = mean_loss + 3 * std_dev_loss
outlier_threshold_low = mean_loss - 3 * std_dev_loss
The outlier thresholds are set to three standard deviations from the mean. This is based on the Empirical Rule, which states that in a normal distribution, approximately 99.7% of data values lie within three standard deviations from the mean.

High Threshold: Values above this threshold are considered high outliers.
Low Threshold: Values below this threshold are considered low outliers.
Note: Adjusting the multiplier (e.g., using 2 instead of 3) will change the sensitivity of outlier detection.

5. Cap the Outliers
python
Copy code
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] > outlier_threshold_high, outlier_threshold_high, df["Net Loss Amount"])
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] < outlier_threshold_low, outlier_threshold_low, df["Net Loss Amount"])
This section caps the outliers:

High outliers (values greater than outlier_threshold_high) are capped to outlier_threshold_high.
Low outliers (values less than outlier_threshold_low) are capped to outlier_threshold_low.
Using np.where ensures that the Net Loss Amount values are either retained or capped based on the defined thresholds, effectively reducing the influence of extreme values.

6. Display the Capped Data and Thresholds
python
Copy code
print(df.head())
print(f"\nHigh Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_high:,.2f}")
print(f"Low Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_low:,.2f}")
This section:

Prints the first few rows of the DataFrame to confirm that the outliers have been capped.
Displays the calculated high and low thresholds, providing context for the values beyond which Net Loss Amount was capped.
Summary
This code serves to detect and cap outliers in the Net Loss Amount column by:

Calculating the mean and standard deviation.
Defining thresholds based on three standard deviations.
Capping values beyond these thresholds to ensure data stability.
Purpose of Capping Outliers
Capping outliers is essential to:

Reduce skewness in the data, which helps maintain more accurate statistical metrics.
Improve model performance by reducing the influence of extreme values.
Enhance data quality, especially in fields like operational risk, where extreme values could be due to anomalies, data entry errors, or rare events.
Additional Notes
Adaptability: This code is designed for datasets where outliers in Net Loss Amount need to be handled to improve statistical or modeling accuracy.
Customization: The code can be modified to use different outlier detection methods, such as the Interquartile Range (IQR), depending on the data’s distribution and the analysis needs.
This concludes the documentation for the outlier detection and capping code. Let me know if you need further explanations or adjustments.

  Below is a detailed documentation for the code, which generates a synthetic operational risk dataset and calculates Value at Risk (VaR) for aggregated loss amounts and event counts. This documentation is intended to help users understand the functionality, parameters, and structure of the code.

Documentation: Synthetic Operational Risk Dataset Generation and VaR Calculation
Overview
This code creates a simulated operational risk dataset with randomly generated data, including Date, Event Type, Business Line, Event Description, and Net Loss Amount. After data generation, it groups the data by Year, Business Line, and Event Type to calculate total loss amounts and event counts. The code then estimates the Value at Risk (VaR) at a 99.9% confidence level for these grouped metrics using a log-normal distribution.

Requirements
Python Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
numpy: For numerical computations and random number generation.
datetime: For generating date ranges.
scipy.stats: For fitting statistical distributions and calculating percentiles (VaR).
Install necessary libraries if they are not already installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scipy
Code Walkthrough
1. Import Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from scipy import stats
This section imports essential libraries for data manipulation, date handling, and statistical analysis.

2. Function to Generate Random Dates
python
Copy code
def random_dates(start, end, n=10):
    return [start + timedelta(days=np.random.randint(0, (end - start).days)) for _ in range(n)]
The function random_dates generates a list of n random dates between start and end:

Parameters:
start: The start date.
end: The end date.
n: The number of random dates to generate (default is 10).
3. Define Parameters for Data Generation
python
Copy code
num_records = 10000
start_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=4*365)
end_date = datetime.now()
num_records: Number of records to generate (10,000 in this case).
start_date and end_date: Define the date range (4 years from today) for random date generation.
4. Define Categories for Business Line and Event Type
python
Copy code
business_lines = [
    "Retail", "Corporate Banking", "Investment Banking", "Insurance",
    "Wealth Management", "Asset Management", "Private Banking",
    "Credit Card Services", "Mortgage Lending", "Financial Advisory"
]

event_types = [
    "Fraud", "System Failure", "Theft", "Compliance", "Natural Disaster",
    "Cyber Attack", "Market Risk", "Operational Error", "Vendor Risk", "Regulatory Violation"
]
These lists provide expanded categories for Business Line and Event Type, which are assigned to records randomly.

5. Generate Synthetic Data
python
Copy code
data = {
    "Date": random_dates(start_date, end_date, num_records),
    "Unique Event ID": [f"EID{str(i).zfill(5)}" for i in range(num_records)],
    "Event Type": np.random.choice(event_types, num_records),
    "Business Line": np.random.choice(business_lines, num_records),
    "Event Description": np.random.choice(
        [
            "Unauthorized transaction", "Server downtime", "Lost assets", 
            "Regulatory fines", "Data breach", "Network failure", 
            "Inadequate compliance", "Financial misstatement", 
            "Supplier issues", "Internal fraud"
        ],
        num_records
    ),
    "Net Loss Amount": np.random.choice(
        [np.random.uniform(-10000, 0) for _ in range(num_records // 2)] + 
        [np.random.uniform(0, 10000) for _ in range(num_records // 2)],
        num_records
    )
}
This section generates a dictionary data with the following keys:

Date: Generated using random_dates.
Unique Event ID: Unique identifiers for each event.
Event Type and Business Line: Randomly assigned from predefined categories.
Event Description: Random descriptions to add context.
Net Loss Amount: Random loss amounts, with half the values negative and half positive, representing losses and gains.
6. Create DataFrame and Add Year Column
python
Copy code
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
This section creates a DataFrame from the data dictionary and adds a Year column by extracting the year from each Date value.

7. Define Function to Fit Distribution and Calculate VaR
python
Copy code
def fit_distribution_and_calculate_var(data, value_col):
    confidence = 0.999  # Set to 99.9%
    var_result = {}
    
    # Check if the data is not empty
    if data[value_col].sum() == 0 or data[value_col].isnull().all():
        return {confidence: np.nan}  # Return NaN if no data

    # Fit a log-normal distribution to the specified column
    shape, loc, scale = stats.lognorm.fit(data[value_col])
    # Calculate VaR for the specified confidence level
    var = stats.lognorm.ppf(confidence, shape, loc=loc, scale=scale)
    var_result[confidence] = var
    return var_result
This function calculates the VaR for a specified confidence level by:

Fitting a log-normal distribution to the specified column (value_col).
Returning NaN if the data is empty.
Calculating the VaR using the ppf function for the specified confidence level (0.999).
8. Group Data by Year, Business Line, and Event Type
python
Copy code
agg_result = df.groupby(['Year', 'Business Line', 'Event Type']).agg(
    Total_Loss_Amount=('Net Loss Amount', 'sum'),
    Event_Count=('Unique Event ID', 'count')
).reset_index()
The data is grouped by Year, Business Line, and Event Type, then aggregated to calculate:

Total Loss Amount: Sum of Net Loss Amount.
Event Count: Count of unique events per group.
9. Calculate VaR for Total Loss Amounts and Event Counts
python
Copy code
agg_result['VaR (99.9%) for Loss'] = agg_result.apply(
    lambda x: fit_distribution_and_calculate_var(agg_result[agg_result.index == x.name], 'Total_Loss_Amount')[0.999], axis=1)

agg_result['VaR (99.9%) for Counts'] = agg_result.apply(
    lambda x: fit_distribution_and_calculate_var(agg_result[agg_result.index == x.name], 'Event_Count')[0.999], axis=1)
These lines apply the fit_distribution_and_calculate_var function to each row in agg_result, calculating:

VaR (99.9%) for Loss: VaR for total loss amounts at 99.9% confidence.
VaR (99.9%) for Counts: VaR for event counts at 99.9% confidence.
10. Display and Save Results
python
Copy code
print(agg_result)
agg_result.to_csv('lda_var_results_with_counts_and_totals_99.9.csv', index=False)
The final results are displayed and saved to a CSV file (lda_var_results_with_counts_and_totals_99.9.csv).

Summary
This code generates synthetic data to simulate an operational risk dataset and calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) for grouped data. The calculated VaR values for Total Loss Amount and Event Count provide insights into extreme values at a high confidence level, enabling more robust risk assessments.
