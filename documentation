  This code snippet loads a dataset and identifies and handles outliers in the Net Loss Amount column by using the mean and standard deviation. It caps outliers that fall beyond three standard deviations from the mean, bringing them within a defined threshold. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Code Explanation
1. Import Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy provides support for numerical operations, such as handling arrays and defining conditions.
2. Load the Dataset
python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv("operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv")
This line loads data from the CSV file operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv into a DataFrame called df.
3. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation
python
Copy code
mean_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].mean()
std_dev_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].std()
mean_loss: The average of the Net Loss Amount values.
std_dev_loss: The standard deviation of Net Loss Amount, which measures the spread of values around the mean. It helps quantify the typical distance of values from the average.
4. Define Outlier Thresholds
python
Copy code
outlier_threshold_high = mean_loss + 3 * std_dev_loss
outlier_threshold_low = mean_loss - 3 * std_dev_loss
These thresholds identify the range beyond which values are considered outliers:
High threshold: Values more than three standard deviations above the mean.
Low threshold: Values more than three standard deviations below the mean.
The choice of "3 standard deviations" is based on the empirical rule (or 68-95-99.7 rule), which states that about 99.7% of data in a normal distribution falls within three standard deviations of the mean.
5. Cap the Outliers
python
Copy code
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] > outlier_threshold_high, outlier_threshold_high, df["Net Loss Amount"])
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] < outlier_threshold_low, outlier_threshold_low, df["Net Loss Amount"])
Here, the code modifies the Net Loss Amount values that exceed the thresholds:
Values above the outlier_threshold_high are capped (set) to outlier_threshold_high.
Values below the outlier_threshold_low are capped to outlier_threshold_low.
Using np.where, this process ensures that extreme values do not skew analyses and that outliers remain within a more reasonable range.
6. Display Results
python
Copy code
print(df.head())
print(f"\nHigh Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_high:,.2f}")
print(f"Low Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_low:,.2f}")
The first few rows of the capped DataFrame are printed using df.head().
The thresholds for high and low outliers are displayed, showing the calculated values formatted as currency.
Summary of Purpose
Capping outliers by setting a maximum and minimum range helps make the data more robust for analysis, ensuring that extremely high or low values do not overly influence calculations such as averages or variances. This approach can provide a more stable basis for data-driven decisions and helps maintain data quality in operational risk analysis.

Here’s a documentation template for the code that detects and caps outliers in the Net Loss Amount column. This can be used for sharing with team members or as part of project documentation.

Documentation: Outlier Detection and Capping for Net Loss Amount
Overview
This document provides an explanation of the code that identifies and caps outliers in the Net Loss Amount column of the dataset operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv. Outlier capping is achieved using a threshold based on the mean and standard deviation of the data. This approach helps mitigate the effect of extreme values on statistical analyses.

Requirements
Python Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and loading CSV files.
numpy: For handling numeric data and implementing conditional logic.
Install these libraries if they are not already installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Code Walkthrough
1. Import Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
This section imports the required libraries:

pandas: Used for data manipulation.
numpy: Used for numerical operations, such as defining conditional statements to cap outliers.
2. Load the Dataset
python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv("operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv")
This line loads the dataset operational_risk_dataset_expanded.csv into a pandas DataFrame called df. The dataset should contain a column named Net Loss Amount for the code to work as intended.

3. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of Net Loss Amount
python
Copy code
mean_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].mean()
std_dev_loss = df["Net Loss Amount"].std()
This step calculates the mean and standard deviation of the Net Loss Amount column:

mean_loss: Represents the average loss amount.
std_dev_loss: Measures the dispersion or spread of Net Loss Amount values around the mean.
4. Define Outlier Thresholds
python
Copy code
outlier_threshold_high = mean_loss + 3 * std_dev_loss
outlier_threshold_low = mean_loss - 3 * std_dev_loss
The outlier thresholds are set to three standard deviations from the mean. This is based on the Empirical Rule, which states that in a normal distribution, approximately 99.7% of data values lie within three standard deviations from the mean.

High Threshold: Values above this threshold are considered high outliers.
Low Threshold: Values below this threshold are considered low outliers.
Note: Adjusting the multiplier (e.g., using 2 instead of 3) will change the sensitivity of outlier detection.

5. Cap the Outliers
python
Copy code
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] > outlier_threshold_high, outlier_threshold_high, df["Net Loss Amount"])
df["Net Loss Amount"] = np.where(df["Net Loss Amount"] < outlier_threshold_low, outlier_threshold_low, df["Net Loss Amount"])
This section caps the outliers:

High outliers (values greater than outlier_threshold_high) are capped to outlier_threshold_high.
Low outliers (values less than outlier_threshold_low) are capped to outlier_threshold_low.
Using np.where ensures that the Net Loss Amount values are either retained or capped based on the defined thresholds, effectively reducing the influence of extreme values.

6. Display the Capped Data and Thresholds
python
Copy code
print(df.head())
print(f"\nHigh Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_high:,.2f}")
print(f"Low Outlier Threshold: ${outlier_threshold_low:,.2f}")
This section:

Prints the first few rows of the DataFrame to confirm that the outliers have been capped.
Displays the calculated high and low thresholds, providing context for the values beyond which Net Loss Amount was capped.
Summary
This code serves to detect and cap outliers in the Net Loss Amount column by:

Calculating the mean and standard deviation.
Defining thresholds based on three standard deviations.
Capping values beyond these thresholds to ensure data stability.
Purpose of Capping Outliers
Capping outliers is essential to:

Reduce skewness in the data, which helps maintain more accurate statistical metrics.
Improve model performance by reducing the influence of extreme values.
Enhance data quality, especially in fields like operational risk, where extreme values could be due to anomalies, data entry errors, or rare events.
Additional Notes
Adaptability: This code is designed for datasets where outliers in Net Loss Amount need to be handled to improve statistical or modeling accuracy.
Customization: The code can be modified to use different outlier detection methods, such as the Interquartile Range (IQR), depending on the data’s distribution and the analysis needs.
This concludes the documentation for the outlier detection and capping code. Let me know if you need further explanations or adjustments.

        [
            "Unauthorized transaction", "Server downtime", "Lost assets", 
            "Regulatory fines", "Data breach", "Network failure", 
            "Inadequate compliance", "Financial misstatement", 
            "Supplier issues", "Internal fraud"
        ],
        num_records
    ),
    "Net Loss Amount": np.random.choice(
        [np.random.uniform(-10000, 0) for _ in range(num_records // 2)] + 
        [np.random.uniform(0, 10000) for _ in range(num_records // 2)],
        num_records

why we use Slide 4: Methodology

Steps for generating random dates, assigning event types and business lines.
Explanation of VaR calculation using log-normal distribution.   what is the alternative approach

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Slide 4, "Methodology," is important because it provides clarity on the specific steps and statistical methods used for data simulation and risk measurement. Understanding the methodology is crucial for stakeholders who want to know how the data and results are derived, ensuring transparency and enabling reproducibility in risk modeling.

Let’s break down why these steps are included and discuss alternative approaches:

1. Steps for Generating Random Dates, Assigning Event Types, and Business Lines
Current Approach:

The current approach simulates dates, event types, and business lines using random sampling, which approximates real-world scenarios in a simplified way. This approach gives us flexibility and speed for generating a large volume of synthetic data that roughly mirrors real distributions.
Alternative Approach:

Instead of random generation, historical patterns could be leveraged if real data were available. For example:
Time Series Simulation: Use actual distributions based on historical data and apply techniques like bootstrapping, ARIMA models, or Markov processes to generate dates and events in a more time-dependent fashion.
Domain-Specific Rules: Introduce rules that certain events (like cyber attacks) are more common in certain business lines or seasons, providing more realistic context to the data.
Agent-Based Models: Simulate events as actions of agents (e.g., hackers, market fluctuations) with specific rules, making the data more representative of complex behaviors in real systems.
2. Explanation of VaR Calculation Using Log-Normal Distribution
Current Approach:

Value at Risk (VaR) calculation in this case uses a log-normal distribution, which is often chosen because losses in financial and operational risk are positively skewed (a common pattern for monetary losses). The 99.9% confidence level helps in assessing extreme risk events with high reliability.
Alternative Approach:

While the log-normal is popular for financial data due to its skew, other approaches can also be effective:
Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD): This distribution is particularly useful for modeling tail risks (extreme losses) and is a common choice for extreme value analysis.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Randomly simulating losses based on historical distributions or assumptions, then calculating the VaR based on simulated outcomes. This provides flexibility and can incorporate non-standard distributions.
Historical VaR: Using actual loss data, this approach ranks historical loss values and identifies the threshold value at the desired confidence level. This is a direct method, though it requires a large volume of data to be accurate.
Hybrid Approach (Filtered Historical Simulation): A combination of historical data and Monte Carlo simulation that adjusts historical data with volatility or other factors, making it adaptable to changing risk conditions.
Each alternative approach has advantages. For instance, GPD or Monte Carlo Simulation may offer better insights for organizations with significant tail risks or those that prefer scenario-based forecasting. Historical VaR and hybrid approaches are more directly data-driven but may need more complex data preparation or cleaning, especially in domains with sparse or highly variable loss data.

Would you like more on any of these alternatives or a specific method applied in code?






You said:
but why in every execution i ma getting differe nt VaR value by using carlo approach
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
When using the Monte Carlo simulation approach, the Value at Risk (VaR) estimate can vary with each execution because Monte Carlo simulations rely on random sampling. Here’s why this happens and how you can manage it:

1. Nature of Random Sampling in Monte Carlo Simulations
In Monte Carlo simulations, we generate a large number of random loss values based on an assumed distribution (e.g., normal or log-normal) that reflects the characteristics of historical losses.
Each run generates a unique set of simulated losses, which means the resulting VaR (often calculated as the 99th or 99.9th percentile of simulated losses) will differ slightly based on this random sample.
2. Number of Simulations (Sample Size)
The number of simulations or "trials" influences the stability of the VaR estimate.
With a small number of trials, the VaR can fluctuate significantly. Increasing the number of simulations (e.g., 10,000 or more) usually leads to a more stable VaR estimate by reducing the impact of random variations.
3. Random Seed for Consistency
Setting a random seed (a fixed starting point for the random number generator) can help achieve consistency across different runs. By setting a seed, you ensure that the random values generated in each simulation are the same every time the code runs, which results in a consistent VaR.
In Python, you can set a random seed using np.random.seed(<some_number>). For example:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)  # Setting the random seed
4. Convergence Issues
Monte Carlo simulations can show slight variability even with a high number of simulations due to the probabilistic nature of the approach.
You can assess convergence by running the simulation multiple times and checking if the VaR stabilizes after a certain number of trials. If the values are still varying, it may indicate a need for more simulations or an adjustment to the distribution used in the simulation.
Example Code Adjustment with Random Seed
Here’s how you could modify the code to include a fixed random seed, which will help in getting a consistent VaR estimate:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

# Set a random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Monte Carlo simulation parameters
num_simulations = 10000
confidence_level = 0.999

# Assume some parameters for loss distribution
mean_loss = 10000
std_dev_loss = 5000

# Run the Monte Carlo simulation
simulated_losses = np.random.normal(mean_loss, std_dev_loss, num_simulations)

# Calculate VaR at the specified confidence level
var_value = np.percentile(simulated_losses, confidence_level * 100)

print(f"VaR (99.9%): ${var_value:,.2f}")
Summary
Using a fixed random seed will give you consistent results across executions, which can be especially helpful for reporting or production environments where reproducibility is important.

Numerical Columns: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max for Net Loss Amount.
Categorical Columns: Explore the frequency of categories in Event Type and Business Line.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Basic summary statistics
summary_stats = df.describe()

# Frequency counts for categorical columns
event_type_counts = df['Event Type'].value_counts()
business_line_counts = df['Business Line'].value_counts()
2.3. Distribution of Losses
Visualize the distribution of Net Loss Amount using histograms or boxplots to identify potential outliers or skewed distributions.
Use separate plots for positive and negative losses to explore asymmetry.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plotting the distribution of net loss amounts
sns.histplot(df['Net Loss Amount'], kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of Net Loss Amount")
plt.xlabel("Net Loss Amount")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()

Use time series analysis or aggregation to visualize events by year or month.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Extract year and month from Date
df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month

# Plot events by year
events_by_year = df.groupby('Year')['Unique Event ID'].count()
events_by_year.plot(kind='bar', title="Events by Year")
2.5. Business Line and Event Type Distribution
Analyze the distribution of event types across business lines to identify areas most affected by certain types of risks.
Example Code:

python

event_business_line = pd.crosstab(df['Business Line'], df['Event Type'])
sns.heatmap(event_business_line, annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu')
plt.title("Heatmap of Event Type vs Business Line")
plt.show()
3. Advanced Analysis: Value at Risk (VaR)
3.1. Distribution Fitting
Fit the Net Loss Amount to a log-normal distribution and calculate Value at Risk (VaR) at a 99.9% confidence level using scipy.stats.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Fit the log-normal distribution and calculate VaR
shape, loc, scale = stats.lognorm.fit(df['Net Loss Amount'])
VaR = stats.lognorm.ppf(0.999, shape, loc=loc, scale=scale)
3.2. VaR Calculation by Business Line and Event Type
Group the data by Business Line and Event Type, then calculate total losses and event counts, followed by the calculation of VaR for each group.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Aggregating by business line and event type
agg_result = df.groupby(['Business Line', 'Event Type']).agg(
    Total_Loss_Amount=('Net Loss Amount', 'sum'),
    Event_Count=('Unique Event ID', 'count')
).reset_index()

# VaR calculation for each business line and event type
agg_result['VaR (99.9%)'] = agg_result.apply(
    lambda x: fit_distribution_and_calculate_var(agg_result[agg_result.index == x.name], 'Total_Loss_Amount')[0.999], axis=1)

Detailed Documentation for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Operational Risk Dataset
This document outlines the steps for conducting a Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Operational Risk Dataset, focusing on key financial risk metrics like Mean Loss, Variance, and Value at Risk (VaR) for different Event Types. The goal is to provide valuable insights into risk patterns and prepare for potential future losses based on historical events.

1. Overview of the Data
The dataset contains various operational risk events, with columns representing key attributes such as Event Type, Net Loss Amount, and the Date of the event. This dataset is used to assess and model operational risks that impact businesses in different industries.

Dataset Columns:

Event Type: The type of event causing the operational loss (e.g., Fraud, Cyber Attack, Natural Disaster).
Net Loss Amount: The financial impact of the event, which can be a loss or gain.
Date: The date when the event occurred.
Business Line: The business unit affected by the event (not used in the code provided but could be included in analysis).
The analysis will focus on Net Loss Amount by Event Type.

2. Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.1. Data Overview
Load the Data: The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv().
Initial Exploration: View the first few records of the dataset to understand its structure and ensure proper data loading.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Check the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())
2.2. Severity Statistics by Event Type
Group the data by Event Type and calculate the following statistics:
Mean Loss: The average financial loss for each event type.
Variance: The variability of losses for each event type.
Count: The number of occurrences of each event type.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Group by Event Type and calculate severity statistics
severity_stats = df.groupby("Event Type")["Net Loss Amount"].agg(['mean', 'var', 'count'])
severity_stats.columns = ['Mean Loss', 'Variance', 'Count']
print("\nSeverity Statistics by Event Type:")
print(severity_stats)
Output Example:

mathematica
Copy code
Severity Statistics by Event Type:
                  Mean Loss      Variance  Count
Event Type                                     
Fraud             -3054.74       21500.12    150
Cyber Attack      -8000.45       62500.98    120
...
2.3. Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation
For each Event Type, calculate the 99% Value at Risk (VaR) using a normal distribution approximation.
The VaR is computed as the mean loss plus a z-score multiplied by the standard deviation of the losses for each event type.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Z-score for 99% confidence level
z_99 = stats.norm.ppf(0.99)

# Function to calculate VaR for each group
def calculate_var(group):
    mean = group["Net Loss Amount"].mean()
    std_dev = group["Net Loss Amount"].std()
    VaR = mean + z_99 * std_dev  # VaR calculation for normal approximation
    return VaR

# Apply the function to each event type
severity_stats['99% VaR'] = df.groupby("Event Type").apply(calculate_var)
print("\n99% Value-at-Risk (VaR) by Event Type:")
print(severity_stats[['Mean Loss', '99% VaR']])
Output Example:

vbnet
Copy code
99% Value-at-Risk (VaR) by Event Type:
                  Mean Loss      99% VaR
Event Type                               
Fraud             -3054.74       -9250.21
Cyber Attack      -8000.45      -14000.23
...
2.4. Visualizing Loss Distributions
Create histograms for each Event Type to visualize the distribution of Net Loss Amount.
Highlight the calculated 99% VaR as a vertical line in the histogram for each event type.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Plotting the loss distribution and VaR for each Event Type
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

for i, event_type in enumerate(df["Event Type"].unique()):
    plt.subplot(2, 2, i + 1)
    losses = df[df["Event Type"] == event_type]["Net Loss Amount"]
    
    # Plot histogram of losses
    plt.hist(losses, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7, density=True)
    
    # Plot VaR line
    VaR = severity_stats.loc[event_type, '99% VaR']
    plt.axvline(VaR, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'99% VaR = ${VaR:,.2f}')
    
    # Labeling and title
    plt.title(f"Loss Distribution for {event_type}")
    plt.xlabel("Net Loss Amount ($)")
    plt.ylabel("Density")
    plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
This code will generate 4 subplots for the first four event types (adjusted if there are more), showing:

The distribution of Net Loss Amount for each event type.

1. Introduction
Objective:
This report presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an operational risk dataset. The focus is on calculating Key Financial Metrics such as Mean Loss, Variance, and Value-at-Risk (VaR) for various operational risk events. The goal is to assess the risks involved with different types of operational failures in a business context, using statistical techniques to forecast potential financial losses.

2. Data Overview and Preprocessing
The operational risk dataset consists of multiple risk events recorded over time, with the following attributes:

Event Type: The category of the event (e.g., Fraud, Cyber Attack, Natural Disaster).
Net Loss Amount: The financial impact associated with the event. This can either be a gain or a loss.
Date: The date on which the event occurred.
Business Line: The business unit impacted by the event (not used in the specific analysis but could be included for further granularity).
The dataset is simulated and consists of 10,000 records, generated using random dates, event types, and financial amounts for each event.

Preprocessing Steps:

Data Cleaning: Ensure no missing values are present and the dataset is structured correctly for analysis.
Conversion of Dates: Convert string-based dates into datetime objects for accurate date-based analysis.
Grouping Data by Event Type: This allows us to summarize the financial impacts of each event category.
3. Methodology for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.1. Grouping Data by Event Type
To understand the severity of each event, we grouped the data by Event Type and calculated three key metrics for each group:

Mean Loss: The average financial loss or gain associated with each event type.
Variance: The spread of financial outcomes (how variable the losses/gains are).
Count: The total number of occurrences of each event type.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Group by Event Type and calculate severity statistics
severity_stats = df.groupby("Event Type")["Net Loss Amount"].agg(['mean', 'var', 'count'])
severity_stats.columns = ['Mean Loss', 'Variance', 'Count']
print(severity_stats)
3.2. Calculating Key Metrics
We applied basic statistical functions to calculate the mean and variance of Net Loss Amount for each Event Type. These statistics give us an overview of the financial impact for each type of operational risk event.

4. Risk Analysis: Value-at-Risk (VaR)
4.1. What is Value-at-Risk (VaR)?
Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a widely used risk measure in finance that estimates the maximum potential loss a portfolio could experience over a specified period, given a certain confidence level. In this analysis, we calculated 99% VaR for each Event Type using a normal distribution approximation.

The formula used for VaR is:

VaR
=
𝜇
+
(
𝑧
𝛼
×
𝜎
)
VaR=μ+(z 
α
​
 ×σ)
Where:

𝜇
μ is the mean of the net loss amount for the event type.
𝜎
σ is the standard deviation of the net loss amount for the event type.
𝑧
𝛼
z 
α
​
  is the z-score corresponding to the 99% confidence level (for this, we use a value of 2.33 from standard normal distribution).
4.2. VaR Calculation for Each Event Type
For each event type, we calculate VaR by determining the mean and standard deviation of losses and applying the formula above.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Z-score for 99% confidence level
z_99 = stats.norm.ppf(0.99)

# Function to calculate VaR for each group
def calculate_var(group):
    mean = group["Net Loss Amount"].mean()
    std_dev = group["Net Loss Amount"].std()
    VaR = mean + z_99 * std_dev  # VaR calculation for normal approximation
    return VaR

# Apply the function to each event type
severity_stats['99% VaR'] = df.groupby("Event Type").apply(calculate_var)
print(severity_stats[['Mean Loss', '99% VaR']])
5. Visualizations
5.1. Loss Distribution and VaR Visualization
To better understand the distribution of losses, we plotted histograms for the Net Loss Amount for each event type. On these histograms, the 99% VaR was overlaid as a red dashed line, indicating the maximum potential loss at the 99% confidence level.

Histogram: The x-axis represents the Net Loss Amount, while the y-axis represents the Density (the frequency of different loss amounts).
VaR Line: The red dashed line marks the 99% VaR, which represents the maximum loss that is expected with 99% confidence.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# Plotting the loss distribution and VaR for each Event Type
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

for i, event_type in enumerate(df["Event Type"].unique()):
    plt.subplot(2, 2, i + 1)
    losses = df[df["Event Type"] == event_type]["Net Loss Amount"]
    
    # Plot histogram of losses
    plt.hist(losses, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7, density=True)
    
    # Plot VaR line
    VaR = severity_stats.loc[event_type, '99% VaR']
    plt.axvline(VaR, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'99% VaR = ${VaR:,.2f}')
    
    # Labeling and title
    plt.title(f"Loss Distribution for {event_type}")
    plt.xlabel("Net Loss Amount ($)")
    plt.ylabel("Density")
    plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
6. User Stories
Risk Manager: "I need to understand how each type of operational risk impacts the bottom line, so I can prioritize mitigation efforts based on the severity of losses."

Executive: "I want a clear understanding of the worst-case financial losses we might incur from different operational risks to make informed business decisions."

Financial Analyst: "I want to calculate and visualize the potential losses using VaR to forecast future financial outcomes and prepare for potential worst-case scenarios."

7. Conclusions and Business Insights
Event Type Risk Profiling: Some event types like Cyber Attacks and Fraud exhibit significantly higher mean losses and variance, indicating higher volatility and greater financial risk.

VaR Insights: The 99% VaR gives a clear indication of the potential financial loss under extreme conditions. For example, a Fraud event with a VaR of -$9,250.21 suggests that the company should be prepared for substantial losses from fraud-related events.

Risk Mitigation Strategies: Based on these insights, risk mitigation efforts can be prioritized for the highest-risk event types, such as Cyber Attacks and Fraud, to minimize financial exposure.
